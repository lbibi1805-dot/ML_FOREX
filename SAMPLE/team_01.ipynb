    "- **Humidity Trend**: Humidity generally exhibits an inverse relationship to temperature. Humidity tends to **decrease** during the hottest months (June-July) and **increase** during cooler months (November to March).\n",
    "  \n",
    "#### Year-by-Year Breakdown:\n",
    "\n",
    "##### 2020:\n",
    "- **Temperature** rises gradually from **18°C** in January to a peak of **32°C** in June before declining sharply toward the end of the year.\n",
    "- **Humidity** is highest during the winter months, reaching over **85%** in January, but decreases to **around 70%** during the summer (June to September) when temperatures peak.\n",
    "  \n",
    "##### 2021:\n",
    "- In 2021, the **temperature** pattern is consistent, with temperatures peaking at around **31°C** in July. \n",
    "- **Humidity** is relatively high early in the year, starting at about **85%** in January and declining to **75%** during the summer, before rising again in the later months.\n",
    "  \n",
    "##### 2022:\n",
    "- **Temperature** in 2022 shows a similar pattern, with peaks around **30°C** in June and July, followed by a drop toward the end of the year.\n",
    "- **Humidity** starts relatively high (above **80%**) in the early months but dips during the summer, with values dropping as low as **65%** in July.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### 2023:\n",
    "- The temperature in 2023 peaks at **30°C** in July, maintaining the same trend observed in previous years. The pattern is fairly consistent.\n",
    "- **Humidity** remains above **80%** in the early months but declines in the mid-year (around **70-75%**) during the warmest period.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### 2024:\n",
    "- In 2024, data is only available until August, but the temperature peaks at **30°C** in June and July.\n",
    "- **Humidity** hovers between **85%** in the early months and gradually decreases to around **75%** as summer approaches.\n",

    "\n",
    "#### Observations:\n",
    "1. **General Trend**:\n",
    "   - As the temperature increases, humidity tends to **decrease**. This inverse relationship is particularly noticeable between temperatures ranging from **15°C to 35°C**.\n",
    "   - However, there is a **range** of temperatures (around **20°C to 30°C**) where the spread of humidity values is quite large, indicating varied humidity levels at these temperatures.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **High Humidity at Low to Mid-Range Temperatures**:\n",
    "   - For lower temperatures (around **10°C to 20°C**), humidity remains high, often **above 70%** and frequently clustering around **80-100%**. This suggests that cooler environments generally tend to have higher humidity levels.\n",
    "   - There are only a few outlier points where humidity drops below **60%** at these lower temperatures, which might represent unusual weather conditions or specific geographic areas.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Convergence at High Temperatures**:\n",
    "   - Between **30°C and 35°C**, most of the humidity values converge, forming a tighter cluster. Here, humidity is primarily **below 80%**, with many data points around **60% to 70%**.\n",
    "   - The dense cluster in this region indicates that as temperatures rise, the variability in humidity decreases, and the relationship becomes more stable, converging toward lower humidity.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Humidity’s Inconsistency in Mid-Range Temperatures**:\n",
    "   - Between **15°C and 25°C**, there is a **wider spread** in humidity values, ranging from **40% to nearly 100%**. This suggests that temperature alone is not enough to determine humidity in this range, and other factors such as wind, rainfall, and local geography might play a significant role in affecting humidity levels.\n",
    "   - This region reflects a period where weather conditions may fluctuate more unpredictably.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Interpretation:\n",
    "- **Inverse Relationship**: The graph suggests a general inverse relationship between temperature and humidity. As temperatures increase, the capacity of the air to hold moisture also increases, causing a decrease in relative humidity.\n",
    "- **Clustering and Spread**:\n",
    "   - At **high temperatures**, humidity is more predictable and clustered in the **60-80%** range.\n",
    "   - At **low and mid-range temperatures**, there is more variance, indicating less predictability in humidity, potentially influenced by seasonal or geographic factors.\n",
    "- **Critical Temperature Points**:\n",
    "   - Around **30°C**, the trend stabilizes, showing that high temperatures often come with lower, consistent humidity values.\n",
    "   - Around **20°C**, there is the greatest spread in humidity, making this range more volatile in terms of predicting the overall climate comfort level.\n",

    "- Across all years (2020 to 2024), **temperature exhibits a consistent seasonal cycle**, with the warmest temperatures occurring in the **mid-year months** and the coldest temperatures towards the **start and end** of the year.\n",

    "- Sea level pressure remains relatively **stable** throughout the year, usually fluctuating between **995 hPa and 1025 hPa**.\n",
    "- In each year, sea level pressure tends to be slightly higher during the **cooler months** (January to March and October to December) and slightly lower in the **warmer months** (June to August). This suggests that sea level pressure is somewhat inversely correlated with temperature.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Year-Specific Insights:\n",
    "- **2020**: Shows a typical seasonal pattern for both temperature and pressure, with temperatures peaking around **30°C** in June and pressure peaking near **1020 hPa** during colder months.\n",
    "- **2021**: This year shows a similar trend, with slightly **lower temperatures** in the colder months (as low as **16°C**). Sea level pressure maintains a steady range, peaking in the cooler months.\n",
    "- **2022**: Similar temperature trends are observed, though with a slightly sharper dip in temperature early in the year. Sea level pressure remains consistent.\n",
    "- **2023**: The temperature pattern is in line with previous years, with a notable drop to around **18°C** at the end of the year. Sea level pressure follows the usual pattern of being stable, with only minor fluctuations.\n",
    "- **2024**: Data only extends until **August**, but the temperature pattern is similar to previous years, peaking at **30°C** during the summer, with steady sea level pressure.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Interpretation of the Relationship Between Temperature and Sea Level Pressure:\n",
    "- **Inverse Relationship**: There is a slight **inverse relationship** between temperature and sea level pressure, where **higher temperatures** (e.g., during the summer months) tend to coincide with **lower sea level pressure** values, and **colder months** tend to have **higher sea level pressure**.\n",
    "- **Seasonal Consistency**: Both temperature and sea level pressure display seasonal consistency across all the years. The **sharp rise** and **fall** in temperatures during the summer and winter months reflect a typical climate cycle, while the more **steady nature** of sea level pressure suggests it is less impacted by seasonal changes compared to temperature.\n",
    "- **Minor Pressure Variations**: Though sea level pressure varies, these fluctuations are **relatively minor** compared to the large swings in temperature, indicating that temperature is much more sensitive to seasonal factors than pressure.\n",

    "   - The whiskers range from **15°C to 40°C**, showing that maximum temperatures can be quite variable.\n",
    "   - The distribution is relatively symmetrical with no outliers.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Feels-like Max (Maximum Perceived Temperature)**:\n",
    "   - The maximum perceived temperature has a median of around **35°C**, with a much larger IQR compared to actual maximum temperatures, spanning from **30°C to 45°C**.\n",
    "   - The whiskers extend from **20°C to over **50°C**, showing a wide range of perceived maximum temperatures.\n",

    "- **Temperature vs. Feels-like**: In general, the **feels-like** temperature tends to have a broader range than the actual temperature, particularly for the **maximum** temperatures. This suggests that factors like humidity, wind, or other environmental factors play a significant role in how temperatures are perceived, especially in extreme conditions.\n",
    "  \n",
    "- **Maximum Temperatures**: The **feels-like max** temperatures show a much wider distribution than actual **temp max**, suggesting that perceived heat is significantly affected by factors beyond just the recorded temperature, often making conditions feel hotter.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Outliers in Feels-like Min**: The outliers in the **feels-like min** category indicate that in some cases, the perceived temperature is much lower than the actual temperature, likely due to environmental conditions such as wind chill or high humidity.\n",

    "**Why Use Mutual Information Over Correlation?**\n",
    "\n",
    "Mutual Information (MI) offers several advantages over traditional correlation measures in data analysis. Unlike correlation, which primarily captures linear relationships, MI can detect non-linear associations between variables, making it particularly valuable in complex systems such as weather prediction. MI doesn't make assumptions about data distribution, contrasting with some correlation measures that presume normal distribution. It's versatile enough to handle both continuous and categorical variables, whereas correlation typically works best with continuous data. MI's sensitivity to complex dependencies allows it to uncover intricate relationships that correlation might overlook. Additionally, MI is scale-invariant, meaning it's not affected by scale transformations of the variables. These characteristics make MI a powerful tool for feature selection and understanding variable relationships, especially in datasets where traditional correlation analysis might fall short."

    "##### Why We Chose to Evaluate the Model Using Average RMSE\n",
    "\n",
    "In our temperature prediction project, we have chosen to evaluate model performance using the **Average RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error)** after applying k-fold cross-validation. This decision is based on several key reasons:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Measuring Absolute Errors**: RMSE allows us to measure the average absolute error between the model’s predictions and the actual temperature values. This is crucial for our project, as it requires a model that can provide the most accurate predictions possible. A low RMSE ensures that the prediction errors are minimal, reducing the risk when applying the model in real-world scenarios.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Weighting Larger Errors**: RMSE emphasizes larger errors (outliers) by squaring the differences, which helps us identify and optimize the model to minimize the most inaccurate predictions. This is particularly important in temperature prediction, where large errors can lead to inaccurate decisions in control systems or forecasting.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Intuitive Interpretation**: RMSE is calculated in the same units as the target variable (temperature), making it easier to interpret the magnitude of the model's errors. For instance, if a model’s RMSE is 1.5°C, we can easily visualize that the model’s predictions deviate from the actual values by an average of 1.5°C, making it easier to communicate this information to stakeholders.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Avoiding Assumptions About Variance**: The \\(R^2\\) metric measures how much of the variance in the data is explained by the model, but in many cases, \\(R^2\\) may not provide enough information about the actual prediction errors. Using RMSE allows us to focus on real accuracy rather than just measuring how well the model fits the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, choosing **Average RMSE** ensures that our model not only fits the data but also provides reliable predictions with high accuracy. This aligns with the core objectives of the project and maximizes the value our product delivers to the end users.\n"

    "##### Why use the Residuals Distribution Plot\n",
    "\n",
    "We also used the **Residual Distribution Plot** to evaluate a model's performance due to these reasons:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Assessing Model Assumptions and Fit**: By using this plot, we can verify if residuals are normally distributed around zero. Based on that, we can detect bias suggesting that the model may consistently over- or under-predicting, or identify outliers.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Complementing Numerical Metrics**: Using the plot help us gained insights not captured by Numerical Metrics (Avg. RMSE in this case). For example, a model can have a low RMSE yet have outliers that are way to extreme may not be a suitable model. The plot can reveal this and help us to compare different models performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Hence, usinng the **Residual Distribution Plot** help us to have a visual and intuitive way assess a model performance. By complementing this plot with numerical metrics, our team can have a more firm reasoning and decision to choose the most suitable for the project.\n"

    "### **Overall Insight from the Predictions vs. Labels Analysis**\n",
    "\n",
    "The comparison between the predicted values and the actual labels shows a pattern of slight overestimation across most instances. While the differences between predicted and actual values are generally small, there are a few notable instances where the model significantly overestimates, indicating room for improvement.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Key Observations**:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **General Overestimation**: The model tends to predict values slightly higher than the actual labels. In 6 out of 9 instances, the model’s predictions are greater than the actual values. This suggests that the model may be biased towards overestimating the outcomes, which could be due to an overfitting tendency on higher values in the training data.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Small Errors in Most Cases**: Despite the overestimation, the majority of the differences between the predicted and actual values are relatively small, typically within a range of 0.3 to 1.6. This indicates that the model is generally performing well and is capable of making fairly accurate predictions in most cases.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Significant Overestimation in Some Cases**: In certain cases, such as Instance 5, the model's overestimation is more pronounced, with a difference of +3.2. This suggests that the model might be struggling with specific conditions or features in the data that cause it to predict higher values than expected. It could benefit from fine-tuning or retraining with additional data to improve performance on these outliers.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Close Performance on Several Instances**: In instances like Instance 2, where the difference is only 0.3, the model demonstrates that it is capable of making very accurate predictions. This shows promise for the model’s overall robustness.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Enhanced Improvement Areas for Model Performance**\n",
    "\n",
    "Building upon the initial insights from the comparison between predictions and labels, it's clear that while the model demonstrates commendable accuracy in several instances, there are specific areas where targeted improvements can significantly enhance its overall performance. Below are detailed recommendations to address the identified issues and further optimize the model:\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **1. Addressing the Overestimation Bias**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Issue Identified**: The model exhibits a tendency to slightly overestimate the actual values in the majority of instances.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Improvement Strategies**:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Adjust the Loss Function**:\n",
    "  - **Use Asymmetric Loss Functions**: Implement loss functions that penalize overestimation more heavily than underestimation. For example, Quantile Loss can be tailored to reduce bias in predictions.\n",
    "  - **Custom Loss Functions**: Design a custom loss function that incorporates penalties for overestimation, encouraging the model to balance its predictions more effectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Regularization Techniques**:\n",
    "  - **L1 and L2 Regularization**: Apply regularization to reduce model complexity and prevent overfitting, which can contribute to biased predictions.\n",
    "  - **Elastic Net**: Combine L1 and L2 regularization to leverage the benefits of both methods, promoting sparsity and reducing variance.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Bias Correction Post-Processing**:\n",
    "  - **Calibration Techniques**: Implement calibration methods such as Platt Scaling or Isotonic Regression to adjust the model's output probabilities and reduce bias.\n",
    "  - **Scaling Predictions**: Apply a scaling factor to the predictions based on the observed bias to bring them closer to the actual values.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **2. Enhancing Model Robustness on Outliers**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Issue Identified**: Significant overestimation in specific instances (e.g., Instance 5) indicates the model struggles with certain outliers or edge cases.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Improvement Strategies**:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Robust Training Data**:\n",
    "  - **Augment Training Data**: Incorporate more samples similar to the outliers to help the model learn from these scenarios.\n",
    "  - **Synthetic Data Generation**: Use techniques like SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique) to create synthetic samples that represent underrepresented cases.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Advanced Feature Engineering**:\n",
    "  - **Interaction Features**: Create interaction terms between features that might influence outlier behavior.\n",
    "  - **Polynomial Features**: Incorporate polynomial features to capture non-linear relationships that may be causing the model to mispredict outliers.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Model Ensemble Techniques**:\n",
    "  - **Stacking**: Combine multiple models to leverage their strengths and mitigate individual weaknesses, improving performance on outliers.\n",
    "  - **Boosting**: Use ensemble methods like XGBoost or LightGBM that focus on correcting the errors of previous models, enhancing robustness against outliers.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Anomaly Detection Preprocessing**:\n",
    "  - **Detect and Handle Outliers**: Implement anomaly detection algorithms (e.g., Isolation Forest, DBSCAN) to identify and appropriately handle outliers before training, either by removing them or treating them differently.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **3. Optimizing Feature Selection and Engineering**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Issue Identified**: Potential room for improvement in the features used for model training, which can impact prediction accuracy.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Improvement Strategies**:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Feature Importance Analysis**:\n",
    "  - **Utilize Feature Importance Metrics**: Leverage model-based feature importance (e.g., from Random Forests, XGBoost) to identify and retain the most impactful features.\n",
    "  - **Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE)**: Systematically remove less important features to enhance model performance and reduce overfitting.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Dimensionality Reduction**:\n",
    "  - **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)**: Apply PCA to reduce feature dimensionality while preserving variance, potentially improving model efficiency and performance.\n",
    "  - **t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE)**: Use t-SNE for visualizing high-dimensional data, aiding in better feature engineering decisions.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Feature Scaling and Transformation**:\n",
    "  - **Standardization**: Ensure all features are on a comparable scale using StandardScaler or MinMaxScaler, which can improve model convergence and performance.\n",
    "  - **Log Transformation**: Apply log transformations to skewed features to stabilize variance and make the data more normal distribution-like.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Incorporate Domain Knowledge**:\n",
    "  - **Create Domain-Specific Features**: Utilize insights from domain experts to engineer features that capture essential patterns and relationships relevant to the prediction task.\n"
